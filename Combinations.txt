Combinations
To limit the amount of simulations, and to have a base of comparison between them, stochastic elements (bidding and routing) have been set to a deterministic behavior (fixed)

    Cooperative winner-pays 2   enabled  balanced    fixed  10000   100     OK
    Cooperative winner-pays 2   disabled balanced    fixed  10000   100     OK
    Cooperative all-pay     2   enabled  balanced    fixed  10000   100     OK
    Cooperative all-pay     2   disabled balanced    fixed  10000   100     OK

"Competitive" simulations have a "sponsorship" parameter fixed at "50%" of budget as maximum sponsorship amount

    Competitive winner-pays 2   disabled balanced    50  fixed   10000   100    OK
    Competitive all-pay     2   enabled  balanced    50  fixed   10000   100    OK
    Competitive all-pay     2   disabled balanced    50  fixed   10000   100    OK

"Emergent Behavior" simulations are much less than possible ones, and crucial parameters are shuffled in order to see most important to further investigate
